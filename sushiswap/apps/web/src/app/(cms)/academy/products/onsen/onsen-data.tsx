    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>
          Triple yield means accumulating three forms of yield on your funds.
          This is made possible when you lend out your funds via Kashi.
        </p>
        <p>How?</p>
        <ol className="pl-4 list-decimal">
          <li>
            Lend out your funds via Kashi and earn interest from borrowers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Idle assets automatically earn a small yield from BentoBox
            strategies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stake the KMP tokens you receive in Kashi farms to earn extra $SUSHI
            rewards.
          </li>

        <p>With Trident it will be possible to do the same with your SLPs</p>

  },
  {
    question: 'What is a 2x reward Farm?',
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>
          A 2x reward farm allows a user to earn $SUSHI & an addition token as a
          reward when their SLP tokens are staked in it. These are extra rewards
          added on top of the trading fees earned from providing liquidity.
        </p>
        <p>
          These farm contracts are named Masterchefv2 (or Minichefv2 on L2 &
          sidechains).
        </p>
        <p>
          This allows other projects that are listed on Sushiswap to incentivize
          their token holders to provide liquidity for that specific token.

    question:
      'What is the difference between MasterChef, MasterChefv2 and MiniChef?',

    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>There are three different types of implementations for Masterchef</p>
        <ul className="pl-4 list-disc">
          <li>
            MasterChefv1: The main contract on the Ethereum network that rewards
            $SUSHI to users for staking their LP and/or KMP tokens.
          </li>
          <li>
            MasterChefv2: Secondary contract on the Ethereum network. It is
            built on top of MasterChefv1 and gives 2 different type of tokens as
            a reward. e.g Users will receive SUSHI & another token as their
            staking reward.
          </li>
          <li>
            MiniChef: This contract is mainly deployed on various EVM compatible
            chains (AVAX, FTM, CELO etc.). It is similar to MasterChefv2, in
            which it also gives 2 different type of tokens as a reward.
