    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>
          Furo is a payment streaming platform that anyone can use to make
          automated payments to other wallets - whether they be for individuals,
          DAOs, or any other type of entity. While it my seem very similar to
          apps like Sablier or Llamapay, there are additional features which
          make Furo particularly appealing. One of these strengths would be the
          utilization of the BentoBox architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other apps require funds to be locked in contract. With Furo, tokens
          sit inside of the BentoBox giving potential for them to also
          simultaneously be utilized by strategies to accrue yield. This
          provides a pleasant way to have your value grow before you even
          receive it! Streams and vesting that are sent via Furo are also
          represented by an NFT minted to the receiving wallet. The owner can
          even send that NFT to another wallet to transfer ownership of the
          stream.
